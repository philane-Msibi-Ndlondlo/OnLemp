                        <h1>About OnLemp</h1>
                        <h3>Problem:</h3>
                        <p>As I am growing through the industry, I have been sending Cvs and developing my portfolio for showcasing to employeers but I didn't get replies back. Research kicked in and I was on a mission to find out why and how to solve it. We send CVs and don't get replies. We spend days, weeks and years without our CVs not getting attention. Graduates don't know how to write CVs so OnLemp is for solving all those problems.</p>

                        <h3>Solution:</h3>
                        <p>There are many things we should look out for in our CVs. Architecture, language, word expression, references, word spelling, etc, all contribute to a well created or written CV or portfolio.</p>


                        <h3>What Recruiters/Employers look for:</h3>
                        <p>They only have 5-7 seconds to review your CV so that is why you should keep your CV short and straightfoward.</p>
                        <p>They look for these things importantly:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Your Name</li>
                            <li>Contact Information</li>
                            <li>Skills</li>
                            <li>Experience</li>
                            <li>At least put 1 of your top project, with a link to your project preview.</li>
                            <li>Education</li>
                            <li>References - Some need these.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>What Recruiters/Employers don't look for:</h3>
                        <p>They only have 5-7 seconds to review your CV so put what's important.</p>
                        <p>They dont look for these things:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Soft Skills - They already expect you to be a Good Communicator, Team Player, hard worker, etc.</li>
                            <li>Hobbies - They want to know what will they benefit from you, not play with you.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>DONTs:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Do not cluster your CV with much information. Learn to Summarize.</li>
                            <li>No Pictures/Photos.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>CV Tips:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <h4>Number of Pages</h4>
                                <p>It depends on your experience on how many pages should your CV have. With no experience to 2 years experience, your CV should be 1 page. With more than 2 years experience then your pages can grow but always keep your CV as short as possible.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h4>Language</h4>
                                <p>Be consistent in your CV. One language. You can mix up to 2 languages but 1 is enough.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h4>Photo</h4>
                                <p>it depends on your career but it is better not to put a photo/picture in your CV. Your employer is going to see you eventually during an interview so no pitcures.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h4>Spelling Check</h4>
                                <p>Always make sure your word spelling 100%. Use Spelling Checkers when writing your CVs.</p>
                            </li>
